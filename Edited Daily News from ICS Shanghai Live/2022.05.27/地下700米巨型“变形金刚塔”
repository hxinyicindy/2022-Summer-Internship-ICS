China's second large-scale neutrino experiment project, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), is currently under construction at 700 meters underground. The construction team has completed construction of a platform, which will be used during the installation of an acrylic sphere, a key component of the central detector of JUNO.
