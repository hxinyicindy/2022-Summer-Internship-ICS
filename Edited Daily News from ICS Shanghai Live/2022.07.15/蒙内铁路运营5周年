The railway was built to ease the pressure on the domestic road network and is an important infrastructure project to boost the local economy. It has shortened the journey between the two cities from 10 hours to just five, meanwhile cutting logistical costs by 40%. As of May 31, 2022, nearly 8 million passengers and 1.77 million TEUs of bulk cargo have been ferried between Nairobi and Mombasa.
