蒙内铁路运营5周年——中国为肯尼亚培养了一支“带不走的队伍”
Chinese-built Modern Railway Leads to Brighter Future for Kenya


Chinese-built modern railway, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), is the first railway to be built in Kenya since its independence in 1963. The railway was built to ease the pressure on the domestic road network and is an important infrastructure project to boost the local economy. It has shortened the journey between the two cities from 10 hours to just five, meanwhile cutting logistical costs by 40%. As of May 31, 2022, nearly 8 million passengers and 1.77 million TEUs of bulk cargo have been ferried between Nairobi and Mombasa.
