Asia’s 1st 300m deep-water offshore platform installed


Haiji-1, Asia’s first 300-meter deep-water fixed oil production platform, is being installed in the South China Sea, about 200 kilometers southeast of Shenzhen. The platform, which is independently designed and built by China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), has fully completed installation, the company announced Tuesday, marking a technological breakthrough in the country’s design and installation of ultra-large offshore oil and gas platform jackets. Haiji-1 spans 302 meters and weighs about 40,000 tons and has a 184-meter working water depth. It is expected to boost the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.
