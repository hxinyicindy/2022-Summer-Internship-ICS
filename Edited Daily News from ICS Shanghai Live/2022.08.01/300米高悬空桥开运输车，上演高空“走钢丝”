If there is anything requiring more caution than walking a tightrope, it is driving a tightrope.

A temporary suspension bridge made of iron chains went viral on the internet recently.

Driving along the 4.3-meter-wide bridge, trucks looked like they are navigating a tightrope.

The bridge spans more than 245 meters over a 300-meter-deep canyon.

With a designed load of 45 tonnes, the bridge is a temporary thoroughfare for delivering materials to another bridge under construction.

The existing roads are not fit for purpose, and would need to be widened to avoid a detour of some 30km.

Therefore, the suspension bridge cuts cost and avoids unnecessary environment damage.
