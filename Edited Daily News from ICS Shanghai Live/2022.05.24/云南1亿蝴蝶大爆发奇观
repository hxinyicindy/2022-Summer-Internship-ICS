With its dense rainforests and well-preserved vegetation, the Butterfly Valley provides a good environment for butterflies to thrive.
Starting from late May each year, a spectacular “butterfly explosion” will appear in the valley as caterpillars break out of cocoons within only a short period. 
In early June this year, more than 100 million butterflies will emerge in the valley.

Butterfly Explosion

More than 100 million Butterflies Will Emerge


With its dense rainforests and well-preserved vegetation, the Butterfly Valley in Jinping county, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China’s Yunnan Province provides a good environment for butterflies to thrive, being home to over 400 butterfly species.

In early June this year, more than 100 million butterflies will emerge in the valley, according to Yang Zhenwen, head of the Butterfly Museum under the Culture and Tourism Bureau of Jinping county.

Starting from late May each year, a spectacular “butterfly explosion” will appear in the valley as caterpillars break out of cocoons within only a short period. They will appear in clusters inside forests and along streams and pathways.
