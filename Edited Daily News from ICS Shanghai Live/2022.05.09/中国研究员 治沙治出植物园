Turpan Eremophyte Botanical Garden
the world’s only botanical garden located below sea level
More than 500 species of salt- and drought-tolerant desert plants

More than 500 species of salt- and drought-tolerant desert plants flourish in the botanical garden, 
Turpan Eremophyte Botanical Garden under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
which is also the world’s only botanical garden located below sea level.

Sandstorm used to rage in Turpan Basin every spring, causing serious impact on agriculture.



In northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, a barren desert area once plagued by quicksand in the Turpan Basin, 
is now a botanical garden filled with lush plants,
thanks to more than four decades of sustained efforts of Chinese researches from generation to generation.
