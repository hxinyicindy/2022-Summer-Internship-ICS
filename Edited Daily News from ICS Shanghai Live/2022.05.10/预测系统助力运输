China applies fine wind forecast system to ensure spacecraft-rocket transfer


China has for the first time realized the fine forecast of Earth's near-surface wind for a major space launch mission.

The forecast system can provide real-time visual weather forecasts based on the latest meteorological information, 
to overcome challenges from the Earth's near-surface wind, which has a great impact on the smooth vertical transfer of spacecraft and rockets.
