Recently, Shaanxi, Shandong and some other provinces, as well as Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have started large-scale "seawater rice" transplanting. 

The strain is grown in salty soil near the sea, and was created by over-expressing a gene from selected wild rice that's more resistant to saline and alkali.


Tests of salt-tolerant ‘seawater rice’ strains have produced high yields and could help China feed its 1.4 billion people.
