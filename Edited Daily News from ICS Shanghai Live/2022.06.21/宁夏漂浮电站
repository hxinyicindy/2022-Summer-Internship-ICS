Floating Solar Panels
in Northwest China's Ningxia


Floating solar panels are placed above the surface of a lake formed by drainage of mining in Majiatan Town.
The solar power plant covers a water area of 20 hectares with a designed installed capacity of 17.94 megawatts.
It is expected to generate green electricity over 25 million kWh per year, 
which will save over 7643.2 tonnes of standard coal and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 21,000 tonnes.
