China's financial market, young and fast-growing, is at a new outset to open up further to the global markets, building on the transformative steps it has taken in the past decade.

The country's equity market and bond market expanded 238.9 percent and 444.3 percent respectively over the past 10 years, now both the second largest worldwide, official data showed.

It has also attracted more foreign investors and institutional investors, diversified investment options, and given rise to a bevy of world-class industry bellwethers.

"Looking ahead, China's financial sector will remain committed to unremitting reform and opening up to ensure long-term stability," said Chen Yulu, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, at a recent press conference.
