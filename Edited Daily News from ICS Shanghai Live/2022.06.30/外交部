tk1:外交部回应七国集团峰会涉华内容
标题：The G7 has no authority to speak for the whole world
文案: 
The G7 used the Leaders' Communiqué to peddle
the "democracy versus authoritarianism" narrative,
interfere in China's internal affairs,
attack and smear China,
and incite confrontational sentiments.

This shows that the G7 has no intention
of having dialogue and cooperation
on the basis of equality and respect,
that the G7 remains entrenched
in its Cold War mentality and ideological bias,
and that the G7 prefers group politics
that serves the group's own interests.

The G7 is preoccupied with
stoking division and confrontation
and has shown absolutely no sense
of responsibility or moral authority.

For a group which accounts for about
one tenth only of the world's population,
the G7 has no authority
to speak for the whole world,
still less to present its own values
and standards as universal values and standards.

标题：British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said China's COVID response unlike authoritarian state.
Countries should not stop governments from taking a responsible approach to fighting COVID-19. 
文案: 
The UK is among the first countries
in the world to opt for "herd immunity".
But the cost for that is
22.61 million infections
and 180,000 deaths.

Countries may differ
in their national realities,
but that should not stop governments
from taking a responsible approach
to fighting COVID-19. 

China has no intention to compare
or compete with any country
in terms of the way we
deal with the virus, 
but we hope the UK side
will put China's approach to COVID-19
into proper perspective. 

To propagate the narrative of
"democracy vs. authoritarianism"
in the context of COVID-19
would only lead to more mistakes
and could take an even heavier
toll on the people.
