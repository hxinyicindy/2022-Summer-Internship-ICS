Since the recent outbreak in Shanghai in early March, 
the number of daily emergency calls has increased to 12 times the amount received last year. 
Under the coordination of the National Health Commission, 
a total of 100 ambulances and about 300 medics arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin City and Henan Province last week. 
They have transported and treated more than 1,000 people in the past 5 days.
